# ThinkBlink
DubHacks2021

ThinkBlink is a Chrome extension designed to remind users of the 20-20-20 rule, where after 20 minutes of screentime, a person should look
at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds to lessen the negative impact of long screen exposure. 

ThinkBlink will also be able to help users who work from home to have a consistent, set schedule each day. Users can insert how many hours they
will work for the day, and the computer will be able to remind users of when they should be done working once the hours have been met. If the user
were to continue to work, the computer will send out memes and reminders for the user to take a break and relax.
